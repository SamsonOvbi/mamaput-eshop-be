   `git fetch upstream`

3. Rebase your local branch onto the latest changes from the original repository:

   `git rebase upstream/main`

4. Push the rebased changes to your forked repository:

   `git push origin main`

### Clone your forked repository to your local machine using

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git`

### Create a new branch for your changes

`git checkout -b your-branch-name`

### Make your changes in the new branch
